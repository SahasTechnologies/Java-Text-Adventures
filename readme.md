## Java Text Adventures
I've decided to make a few text adventures in Java to learn about the language and become more familiar with it's functions.
**Go to index.java to play!** _(sorry im too used to html so i just called it index)_
#### Here are the text adventures you can play
1. Spaceship - You wake up to find yourself inside a spaceship, and you have 180 seconds to escape before the spaceship takes off!
2. Triton - You're a researcher in Habitat Triton, a small research station in the Mariana Trench. Suddenly, something breaks, and water starts to sink in. You have to repair and signal for help before the backup oxygen runs out.


## Some other games
So... only text adventures is a bit boring, especially when you're spending upwards of 3 hrs on each one 🥲🥲. So I plan to create other games too which can work in the terminal and I'll have to find some way to update the terminal live.
